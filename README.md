MOTIVATION:
Let's be honest, it's hard to get your tech team to sit down at a meeting that doesn't involve a board, <br>
instrument or new wireless set to try out. <br>
But we all need to get better and that requires what every tech person dreads... feedback. <br>
In this case feedback is good, so go ahead share video resources, discuss how we can improve and let's get on the same page.<br>
BandAide is a quick stop for your tech team to get the word out about upcoming events or to discuss recent sound issues.

SUMMARY: 
A One Stop Shop for Church Tech Team Communication
