# BandAide

## Summary
A One Stop Shop for Church Tech Team Communication

## Motivation
Let's be honest, it's hard to get your tech team to sit down at a meeting that doesn't involve a board, 
instrument or new wireless set to try out. 
But we all need to get better and that requires what every tech person dreads... feedback. 
In this case feedback is good, so go ahead share video resources, discuss how we can improve and let's get on the same page.
